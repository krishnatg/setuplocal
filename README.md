# setuplocal
various scripts I use to customize my personal environment

- setupMuteBeforeShutdown: Use this script to ensure that you don't hear the annoying start-up chime of a Mac irrespective of the volume at the time of shutdown. This script will mute the system volume when you tell your Mac to shutdown. Run this script from any local path, enter your password (since the script executes a 'sudo'), and that is it!
